## About

A fourth-year CSE student at BRAC University with a strong interest in cybersecurity and ethical AI. I enjoy exploring how technology can be built responsibly and securely.

Outside of tech, I love photography, watching movies and having meaningful conversations. I also really value proper sleep, it's a big part of how I take care of myself.

I believe in lifelong learning, leading with kindness and the strength that comes from being part of a supportive community.
