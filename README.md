## About

A fourth-year CSE student at BRAC University with a strong interest in **AI/ML-based intrusion and threat detection systems**. I enjoy exploring how machine learning and neural networks can be applied to **identify, analyze, and explain malicious behavior** in modern systems.

I'm particularly interested in building **responsible and explainable AI models**, especially in security-sensitive domains where trust, transparency, and reliability are critical.

Outside of tech, I enjoy photography, watching movies, and having meaningful conversations. I value proper sleep and long-term wellbeing, they're essential to how I learn, think, and work sustainably. I believe in lifelong learning, leading with kindness, and the strength that comes from being part of a supportive community.
