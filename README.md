## 🔥 About Me

Hi, I’m **B M Rauf**, a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at **BRAC University, Bangladesh**. I’m passionate about **Cybersecurity** and **Machine Learning**, and I plan to focus on **"Machine Learning for Cybersecurity"** for my undergraduate thesis, which I will begin in **Fall 2025**.

While these areas excite me the most, I’m also curious about exploring other tech fields like **Image Processing, Quantum Computing**, and **Web Development**. I’m always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges that allow me to contribute.
